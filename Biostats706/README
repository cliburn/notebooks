To run the examples, you need to install Python and several optional modules, especially IPyython. I recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution, which you can download from https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/, which includes everything you need in a convenient binary installer.

Copy the CodeExamples folder to your computer and navigate to it using a Terminal. Start an IPython notebook server in the CodeExamples folder by typing

ipython notebook --pylab=inline

and a new browser window should open with a list of the code exampls. Click on one of them to open it. You can evaluate Python directly wihtin the opened browswer tab.

Feel free to come see me if you have any difficulties getting it to work, of if you want to find out more about Python - I am always evangelizing the language ;-)

Thanks,
